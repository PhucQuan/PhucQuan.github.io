## Background

I'm a security student with a focus on offensive security through competitive hacking and hands-on labs. This blog documents my learning journey in security research, CTF challenges, and penetration testing.

## Current Focus

- **Competitive Hacking** — CTF competitions (web, crypto, misc)
- **Penetration Testing** — Web application assessments
- **Cloud Security** — AWS and cloud infrastructure security
- **Cryptography** — Algorithm analysis and implementation flaws
- **Reverse Engineering** — Binary analysis basics

## Skills

**Programming Languages:**
- Python (scripts, exploitation)
- Bash (automation, reconnaissance)
- JavaScript (web vulnerabilities)
- SQL (database security)

**Tools & Platforms:**
- Burp Suite, Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit
- TryHackMe, HackTheBox, CTFtime
- Ghidra, IDA Pro (basics)

**Technical Knowledge:**
- Web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Authentication and authorization bypasses
- Cryptographic concepts and flaws
- Network protocols and analysis
- Linux system administration

## Learning Path

### Completed
- ✅ TryHackMe security fundamentals
